are two possible approaches to equalising constituencies: providing equal access to representation, and providing equality during an election.</li><li>The first suggests equalising constituents (which includes non-voting residents), the second involves equalising registered or potential voters.</li><li>Historically there was not much difference between these two groups. Increases over the last few decades in the population ineligible to vote mean that these different principles are now likely to lead to different results.</li><li>Equalising on registered voters shifts results slightly in favour of the Conservative party, while equalises on population shifts results slightly in favour of the Labour party.</li><li>Arguments made by political parties are reflective of their position in the system. The principles they see as important tend to be those that justify their current power, or that critique their current lack of it.</li><li>Arguments for equality of access to representation depend on the idea that an MP represents all their constituents. But the presence of non-voters changes the political result without their input. Representation without participation cannot reliably be to an individual or a group's benefit.</li><li>Arguments for equality during an election require going beyond equal boundaries to reforms that deliver proportional results.

My position is that this is an accident of history rather than a deliberate choice. When there was a wide gulf between the electorate and the population in the early twentieth century, the constituencies were equalised on the overall population. The conceptual and practical difference between the two closed with the extension of the franchise to almost all of the population, and only re-opened with significant migration from non-Commonwealth countries in the 21st century. In between those times, there is little sense in arguments about voting rights that the population and electorate were seen as substantially different groups of people. It is in this middle period where the modern system of reapportionment was created, and so the democratic problem of resident non-voters is not addressed.</p></div><a class="noscript-anchor" name="2.9.lizgj.oeuwr.dlbhh.cbbtt"></a> <a class="anchor" end_key="dlbhh" key="lizgj" letter_key="cbbtt" name="9" parent="2" position_key="9" start_key="oeuwr"></a><div class="content-row" id="r9"><a aria-hidden="true" class="cite-link cite-copy" href="https://research.alexparsons.co.uk/equal-seats/l/2.9.lizgj.oeuwr.dlbhh.cbbtt.html" id="c9" para_tag="" tabindex="-1" title="Get paragraph link"><i class="icon-link"></i></a><p id="p9">The increased number of resident non-voters means different approaches result in political differences in election results.

While people become more likely to be registered the longer they live at an address, groups like private renters are moving much more and so are having the clock constantly reset. This means that as a group, private renters are 58% complete on the register compared to 86% for those owning a house with a mortgage.

Changing the criteria to balance on population would not only have an impact on service provision, but on political balance.

The resulting compromise of counting a slave as three-fifths of a person is often read as an injustice to those enslaved, but slave owners would have preferred it if they were recognised as full (but unfree) persons.
