     {"title": "Summary", "text": "There are two possible approaches to equalising constituencies: providing equal access to representation, and providing equality during an election. The first suggests equalising constituents (which includes non-voting residents), the second involves equalising registered or potential voters. Historically there was not much difference between these two groups. Increases over the last few decades in the population ineligible to vote mean that these different principles are now likely to lead to different results.Equalising on registered voters shifts results slightly in favour of the Conservative party, while equalises on population shifts results slightly in favour of the Labour party. Arguments made by political parties are reflective of their position in the system. The principles they see as important tend to be those that justify their current power, or that critique their current lack of it.Arguments for equality of access to representation depend on the idea that an MP represents all their constituents. But the presence of non-voters changes the political result without their input. Representation without participation cannot reliably be to an individual or a group&#39;s benefit. Arguments for equality during an election require going beyond equal boundaries to reforms that deliver proportional results. The same objections to representation without participation applies if participation isn&#39;t meaningful. In both cases the problem results from a lack of political representation (people having the representative they would choose to represent them) rather a lack of numeric representation.Extending voting rights to all residents resolves the rift between the population and the electorate, and smooths over several practical issues of representation.", "tags": "", "url": "index.html#1.1.3lsjy.ex9xi.lslao.ajxb0"},
